# hello-world
Beginner level depository for nooooobs!!!
My name is Kuan Zhassulan(). I am a citizen of Kazakhstan Republic, second year undergraduate student, a brother to two siblings, a son to 1 mother and the smartest kid on earth. I believe in empyrical science and cathegorical imperatives. I firmly reject rationalism and existentialism. You can already see that I must be fun at parties.
